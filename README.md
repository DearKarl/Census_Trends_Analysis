# Census Latent Patterns Analysis in England & Wales

A streamlined workflow that employs machine learning techniques to harmonise census geographies, infer latent socio-demographic constructs, and analyse regional dynamics across England and Wales.  

## Project Overview  

This project develops a reproducible analytics pipeline to explore socio-demographic structures in England and Wales using 2011 and 2021 Census data. It integrates multi-table census inputs (accommodation type, tenure, occupancy, car availability), harmonises geographies across years, constructs Bayesian latent indices with credible intervals, and applies machine learning techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, K-Means) to identify interpretable population patterns. Outputs are exported in Tableau-ready CSVs for comparative socio-economic visualisation.

## Background  

Socio-demographic comparison across Census years in England and Wales presents two major challenges:  
(1) **geographical inconsistency** caused by boundary changes between 2011 and 2021, and  
(2) **high-dimensionality** of census tabulations that obscures interpretable social patterns.  

This study aims to resolve these challenges through machine learning techniques. By harmonising geographies with text-matching algorithms, applying Bayesian latent variable models to derive socio-demographic constructs such as deprivation, housing strain, tenure instability, and mobility access, and embedding these indices into low-dimensional spaces using non-linear dimensionality reduction methods (t-SNE, UMAP), the pipeline enables interpretable discovery of underlying patterns. Clustering with K-Means then identifies structural groupings across local authorities, while uncertainty quantification through Bayesian inference ensures that cross-year comparisons remain statistically robust. The outcome is a reproducible machine learning workflow that transforms raw census tables into uncertainty-aware, interpretable, and visualisable socio-economic insights.   

## Key Features  

- **Geographical Harmonisation:** Resolve boundary inconsistencies between the 2011 and 2021 Census through automated text-matching algorithms, including TF-IDF similarity, token-based alignment, and explicit split–merge rules.  
- **Bayesian Latent Modelling:** Employ Bayesian Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with variational inference to construct latent socio-demographic indices. The Bayesian model integrates multiple observed indicators into theoretically informed constructs such as deprivation, housing strain, tenure instability, and mobility access.  
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Use Bayesian inference to estimate posterior distributions, reporting posterior means with 95% credible intervals for each latent index.
- **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:** Apply representation learning methods (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to reduce the high-dimensional census space into low-dimensional manifolds. Unsupervised clustering with K-Means is used to detect emergent regional typologies and socio-economic groupings.  
- **Visual Analytics and Interpretability:** Export of harmonised, modelled, and clustered outputs in Tableau-compatible formats, supporting visualisation of spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in socio-economic change.
